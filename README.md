# Octree-Python
Created an Octree implementation in Python where you can:
1. Change the point capacity of the Tree
2. Create queries in the form of boxes or spheres
3. Change the measurements of the queries or of the Octree

There is also a method to get the visualization in Pygame, but you can use the tree without Pygame
